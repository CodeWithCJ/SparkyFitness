## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the SparkyFitness application running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

### Installation

1.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (where `docker-compose.yml` is located).
    Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file and fill in the appropriate values.

    **Key Environment Variables to Configure:**
    *   `SPARKY_FITNESS_SERVER_URL`: The full URL to your backend server (e.g., `http://your_backend_ip_or_domain:3010`). This is used by the frontend to connect to the backend.
    *   `SPARKY_FITNESS_FRONTEND_URL`: The full URL of your frontend application (e.g., `http://your_frontend_ip_or_domain:3004`). This is used by the backend for CORS configuration to allow requests from your frontend.
    *   `SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_NAME`, `SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_USER`, `SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_PASSWORD`: Database credentials.  Try not to change anything as I didn't test properly. Go with defaults
    *   `SPARKY_FITNESS_API_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`: Security keys for the backend. Use the command given in the example env file to generate keys. Otherwise App will fail due to security constraints

2.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    Pull the Docker images and start the services. If you've made changes to the `.env` file, you should rebuild the images to ensure the new environment variables are picked up.
    ```sh
    docker-compose pull # Pull the latest Docker images
    docker-compose up -d # Start the services in detached mode
    ```
   

3.  **Access the Application:**
    Once the services are up and running, access SparkyFitness in your web browser at the URL configured for your frontend (e.g., `http://localhost:3004` or `http://your_frontend_ip_or_domain:3004`).

4.  **AI Chatbot - Optional Configuration:**
    To enable the AI Chatbot's full functionality, you will need to configure the necessary API keys within the application's settings after logging in.
