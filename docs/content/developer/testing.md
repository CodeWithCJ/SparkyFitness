# Testing

Comprehensive testing is an integral part of the SparkyFitness development workflow, ensuring the reliability, correctness, and stability of the application.

## Testing Strategy

SparkyFitness employs various testing methodologies:

*   **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual functions, components, or modules in isolation.
*   **Integration Tests**: Verify the interactions between different parts of the application (e.g., frontend components with backend APIs, backend services with the database).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulate real user scenarios to ensure the entire application flow works as expected.

## Running Tests

Tests can be run from both the frontend (`src/`) and backend (`SparkyFitnessServer/`) directories.

### Frontend Tests

Frontend tests are typically run using Jest and are configured in `package.json` in the root directory.

```bash
# Run all frontend tests
npm test
```

### Backend Tests

Backend tests are located in the `SparkyFitnessServer/tests/` directory and are run using a separate command.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd SparkyFitnessServer

# Run all backend tests
npm test
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests cover the interaction between frontend and backend, or between different backend services.

```bash
# Run integration tests (from the root directory)
npm run test:integration
```

## Code Quality and Best Practices

*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Consider writing tests before implementing new features.
*   **Code Coverage**: Aim for high code coverage to ensure most of your codebase is tested.
*   **Mocking and Stubbing**: Use mocking and stubbing techniques for external dependencies (APIs, databases) to isolate tests and improve performance.
*   **Clear Assertions**: Write clear and concise assertions that accurately reflect the expected behavior.
