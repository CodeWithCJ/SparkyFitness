# API Reference

This document provides comprehensive information about the SparkyFitness API, including OpenAPI specification, endpoints, and integration guidelines.

## OpenAPI Specification

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs. It allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without access to source code, documentation, or network traffic inspection.

## Purpose in SparkyFitness

For SparkyFitness, an OpenAPI specification would serve several key purposes:

*   **API Documentation**: Provides clear and interactive documentation for all backend API endpoints, including request parameters, response structures, and authentication methods.
*   **Client Code Generation**: Enables automatic generation of client SDKs (Software Development Kits) in various programming languages, simplifying integration for third-party applications or mobile clients.
*   **API Testing**: Facilitates automated testing of API endpoints, ensuring consistency and correctness.
*   **Design and Collaboration**: Serves as a single source of truth for API design, improving collaboration between frontend and backend developers.

## Key Elements of SparkyFitness's API (as described by OpenAPI)

An OpenAPI specification for SparkyFitness would detail:

*   **Endpoints**: All available API routes (e.g., `/api/food`, `/api/users`, `/api/exercises`).
*   **Operations**: HTTP methods supported for each endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
*   **Parameters**: Input parameters for each operation, including their types, formats, and whether they are required.
*   **Responses**: The structure of successful and error responses, including status codes and data models.
*   **Authentication**: How clients authenticate with the API (e.g., JWT tokens).
*   **Data Models (Schemas)**: Definitions of the data structures used in requests and responses (e.g., `FoodItem`, `UserProfile`, `ExerciseEntry`).

## Accessing the API Documentation

While a live, interactive OpenAPI documentation (like Swagger UI) might be available in development environments, the core API is consumed by the SparkyFitness frontend and can be explored by examining the backend routes in `SparkyFitnessServer/routes/` and the service definitions in `SparkyFitnessServer/services/`.
