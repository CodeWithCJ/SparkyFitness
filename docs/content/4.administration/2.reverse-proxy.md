# Reverse Proxy

This page will provide details on configuring a reverse proxy for SparkyFitness.

If using a proxy like Nginx Proxy Manager, ensure the following headers are configured:

```nginx
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Ssl on;
```

This sample can be found under [sample](https://github.com/CodeWithCJ/SparkyFitness/wiki/Sample-Setup)

If you want to rely on docker networking instead, choose the scheme ```http```, enter the container name ```sparkyfitness-frontend```
and port ```80```.Note: In order for docker networking to work, the Nginx Proxy Manager network has to be connected to the ```sparkyfitness-frontend``` container. You can find the name of your networks using ```docker network ls```, find the container name using ```docker container ls``` and connect them using ```docker network connect network container```.
