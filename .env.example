# SparkyFitness Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env in the root directory and fill in your own values before running 'docker-compose up'.

# --- PostgreSQL Database Settings ---
# These values should match the ones used by your PostgreSQL container.
# For Docker Compose deployments, SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_HOST will be the service name (e.g., 'sparkyfitness-db').
# For local development (running Node.js directly), use 'localhost' or '127.0.0.1' if PostgreSQL is on your host.
SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_NAME=sparkyfitness_db
SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_USER=sparky
SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_PASSWORD=password
SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_HOST=localhost
SPARKY_FITNESS_DB_PORT=5432

# --- Backend Server Settings ---
# The hostname or IP address of the backend server.
# For Docker Compose, this is typically the service name (e.g., 'sparkyfitness-server').
# For local development or other deployments, this might be 'localhost' or a specific IP.
SPARKY_FITNESS_SERVER_HOST=sparkyfitness-server
# The external port the server will be exposed on.
SPARKY_FITNESS_SERVER_PORT=3010

# The public URL of your frontend (e.g., https://fitness.example.com). This is crucial for CORS security.
# For local development, use http://localhost:8080. For production, use your domain with https.
SPARKY_FITNESS_FRONTEND_URL=https://fitness.example.com
#http://localhost:8080

# Allow CORS requests from private network addresses (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, localhost, etc.)
# SECURITY WARNING: Only enable this if you are running on a private/self-hosted network.
# Do NOT enable on shared hosting or cloud environments where other users might access your network.
# Default: false (secure default - only the configured SPARKY_FITNESS_FRONTEND_URL is allowed)
ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_CORS=false

# Logging level for the server (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR)
SPARKY_FITNESS_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Node.js environment mode (e.g., development, production, test)
# Set to 'production' for deployment to ensure optimal performance and security.
NODE_ENV=production

# Server timezone. Use a TZ database name (e.g., 'America/New_York', 'Etc/UTC').
# This affects how dates/times are handled by the server if not explicitly managed in code.
TZ=Etc/UTC

# --- Security Settings ---
# A 64-character hex string for data encryption. 
# You can generate a secure key with the following command:
# openssl rand -hex 32
# or
# node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
SPARKY_FITNESS_API_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_byte_hex_key

# Better Auth Secret
# A 64-character hex string (or long random string) used to sign sessions.
# You can generate a secure secret with:
# openssl rand -hex 32
# or
# node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret


# --- Signup Settings ---
# Set to 'true' to disable new user registrations.
#SPARKY_FITNESS_DISABLE_SIGNUP=true


SPARKY_FITNESS_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com

# --- Email Settings for Password Reset ---
# Configure your SMTP server details for sending emails.
SPARKY_FITNESS_EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
SPARKY_FITNESS_EMAIL_PORT=587
SPARKY_FITNESS_EMAIL_SECURE=false # Use 'true' for 465 (SSL), 'false' for 587 (TLS)
SPARKY_FITNESS_EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
SPARKY_FITNESS_EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
SPARKY_FITNESS_EMAIL_FROM="SparkyFitness Support <support@example.com>"


# --- Login Management Fail-Safe ---
# Set to 'true' to force email/password login to be enabled, overriding any in-app settings.
# This is a fail-safe to prevent being locked out if OIDC is misconfigured.
SPARKY_FITNESS_FORCE_EMAIL_LOGIN=true


# --- API Key Rate Limiting (Optional) ---
# Override the default rate limit for API key authentication (used by automation tools like n8n).
# Defaults to 100 requests per 60-second window if not set.
#SPARKY_FITNESS_API_KEY_RATELIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000
