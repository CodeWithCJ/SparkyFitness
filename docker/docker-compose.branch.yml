# Docker Compose configuration for using branch-specific pre-built images
# This file is designed to use images automatically built by GitHub Actions
# when you push to your feature/fix branches (e.g., claude/*)
#
# Usage:
#   1. Set your branch name in .env file:
#      IMAGE_TAG=claude-authentik-proxy-auth-setup-011cv2eprxqy243vyrwvg1mw
#
#   2. Run with this compose file:
#      docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.branch.yml up -d
#
#   3. Or override tag directly:
#      IMAGE_TAG=main docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.branch.yml up -d
